        <p>
            My time as an Executive Assistant to business consultants and accountants has given me excellent communication and relationship-building skills that are applicable to a diverse audience. I can create rapport with almost anyone I encounter, and my ability to read the room and engage in a contextually appropriate way made me the go-to person for liaising with a variety of people in a variety of situations.<br/>
            <br>
            My years with accountants have also made me a trustworthy partner regarding sensitive, time-bound, or otherwise extra-ordinary communications. I am flexible and accommodating when needed, and I have strong ethical and personal boundaries which I communicate when the need arises.<br/>
            <br>
            Educationally, I am currently a 2nd year Marketing and Digital Marketing student at Bow Valley College. I am tech-savvy, and enjoy the challenge of thinking on my feet, and completing a job to the best of my ability. I also have a masterâ€™s degree in music, which has helped form my outgoing and engaging personality, as well as refined my commitment to positive workplace culture, as well as to clear, effective communication.<br/>
