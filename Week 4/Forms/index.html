<!--- Forms.  Know what type of input type it is: text, radio or submit-->
<!-- under submit, don't worry about the action attribute.  That's for developer server-side.  the Value=Submit makes it a button-->
<!-- target tells the thing to open a new tab.  target="blank"
Each input field must have a name attribute field to be submitted.  If there isn't a name attribute, then the data won't go anywhere.

<input type="text">	    Defines a one-line text input field
<input type="radio">	Defines a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
<input type="submit">	Defines a submit button (for submitting the form)
-->
<!-- Fieldset creates a nice little box around your form -->

<form>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>who's the boss?</legend>
      First name:<br>
      <input type="text" name="firstname"><br>
      Last name:<br>
      <input type="text" name="lastname"><br>
      <br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </fieldset>
  </form>
