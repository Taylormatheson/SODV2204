<h3 id="story">About Adrianne</h3>
    <p>Adrianne Pieczonka is a candaian soprano who has sung across the world. The dramatic Soprano went to school in Ontario, at the University of Toronto and at Western University. In 2019 she was appointed "Chair in Voice" at the Glenn Gould School at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. In this role, she gives regular masterclasses, and oversees the vocal department and their opera productions.
    </p>

    <p>She has released a CD 'Adrianne Piecczonka Sings Strauss and Wagner' and her regordings of Puccini arias won a JUNO award and was named disk of the year/opera award by BBC magazine.  Her album 'Beethoven: Ideals of the French Revolution' also won a JUNO. Her performances of Elektra, Simon Boccanegra, Der Rosenkavalier, and DonGiovanni have all been immortalized on DVD.</p>

    <p>It is not uncommon for opera singers to perform the same role several times over the course of their career. The information available on Adrianne's website allows for an interesting analysis of the roles she has sung since 2015.  There are two contributing factors to these numbers. The first is the popularity of the operas themselves; often operas will be produced in waves - if one company in a country produces an opera, in increases the likelyhood of that show being produced in another city in that country the next season. The second contributing factor is the career of the singer. Adrianne had a big year for her career in 2017, and then took some time to focus on teaching, recitals, and recordings, and so her overall numbers of operas performed have dropped in recent years.  However, and at the time of this writing most opera companies had not released details of their 2020/2021 seasons yet, and so not all of Ms. Pieczonka's engagements may not have been publicly available.  </p>
