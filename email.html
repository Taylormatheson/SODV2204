    <p>Hello Roger,</p>
    <p>I missed class today!   I hear that we had groups assigned to us, so I thought I'd reach out to do the following: </p>
    <ol>    
        <li>Check in to see who else was in my group (or what number I was assigned, or however that worked out) </li>    
        <li>See where we got up to in the lecture, so I can be all caught up</li>    
        <li>Ask if there was any homework or pre-work assigned for next class.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thanks,</p>
    <p>Taylor</p>
